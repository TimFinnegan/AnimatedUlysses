HTML5 animations of Joyce's Ulysses

HTML5 has some commands that allow animated figures to move around background graphics, so it seems pretty simple to animate the basic paths of the main figures in Ulysses. Without using any javascript code, we should be able to evolve shared and/or customised animated illustrations.
-The backgrounds will try to offer accurate proportions.
-Characters believed to be within the background can be included even if the text hasn't mentioned them yet.
-Character-animation is via 'sprite sheets'. (Bloom looks a lot like Mario, conveniently.)
-I'm still not sure what all HTML5 can do, but it would be nice if we can have one page per chapter with a 'play/start-over' button that starts a non-interactive 'movie'.
-Emojis may take the place of characters, eg in the super-complex ch10.
-Boring chapters like ch3 and ch9 will need creative tricks.
