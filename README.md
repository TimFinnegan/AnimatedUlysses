# AnimatedUlysses
HTML5 animations of Joyce's Ulysses

This project is an unexpected spinoff of a collection of platform-ideas for simulating Ulysses: http://simulatingulysses.blogspot.com/2016/04/sidescroller.html

HTML5 has some commands that allow animated figures to move around background graphics, so it seems pretty simple to animate the basic paths of the main figures in Ulysses. Without using any javascript code, we should be able to evolve shared and/or customised animated illustrations.

I'm not consistently syncing sheet3.html here with http://fwpages.neocities.org/sheet3.html (i use neocities instead of blogspot because editing the css is easier)

- The backgrounds will try to offer accurate proportions, hopefully about 600px wide.

- Characters believed to be within the background can be included even if the text hasn't mentioned them yet.

- Character-animation is via 'sprite sheets'. (Bloom looks a lot like Mario, conveniently.)

- I'm still not sure what all HTML5 can do, but it would be nice if we can have one page per chapter with a 'play/start-over' button that starts a non-interactive 'movie'.

- I'm expecting to figure out how to assign multiple characters multiple overlapping starting and finishing places and times. (If there are technical limits, we'll have to retreat to next-best workarounds.) 'Animation-delay' sets a starting time and 'animation-duration' calculates an ending time...? But every spritesheet has to be treated as completely separate/independent?

- Emojis may take the place of character-animations, eg in the super-complex ch10.

- Boring chapters like ch3 and ch9 will need creative tricks.

- Maybe speeches and thoughts can be 'summarised' in emoji? (requiring lots of new animations)
